My team and I took on the user research for the development of [_VR the Change_](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/projects/2017/vr-change){:target="_blank"}, a virtual reality (VR) experience for the HTC Vive aimed at improving climate change awareness and sustainable behaviors. By conducting a focus group on behavioral change, evaluative interviews and followup of the in-development VR experience, and a competitive review of existing media with similar aims, we were able to provide actionable points of feedback for the development team.
