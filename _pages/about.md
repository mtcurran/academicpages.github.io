Hi, I'm a PhD student at the [UC Berkeley School of Information](http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"} where I study the design and development of digital technologies and the people who use them. As a member of the [BioSENSE](http://biosense.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"} group, I research the applications and implications of the collection, interpretation, and sharing of data captured from our bodies and behaviors.

Before graduate school I worked on research at the [Massachusetts General Hospital Center for Addiction Medicine](http://www.mghaddictionmedicine.com/){:target="_blank"} and the [Nobeyama Radio Observatory](http://www.nro.nao.ac.jp/en/){:target="_blank"}, a branch of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan. I completed my undergraduate education at the [University of Massachusetts, Amherst](http://www.umass.edu/){:target="_blank"}.
