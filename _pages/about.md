Hi, I'm a PhD student at the UC Berkeley School of Information where I study the design and development of digital technologies and the people who use them. As a member of the [BioSENSE](http://biosense.berkeley.edu) group, I research the applications and implications of collecting, interpreting, and sharing data produced by our bodies and behaviors.
