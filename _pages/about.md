Hi, I'm a PhD student at the [UC Berkeley School of Information](http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"} where I study the design and development of digital technologies and the people who use them. As a member of the [BioSENSE](http://biosense.berkeley.edu/){:target="_blank"} group, I research the applications and implications of the collection, interpretation, and sharing of data produced by our bodies and behaviors.
