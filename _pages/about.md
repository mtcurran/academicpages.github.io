Hi, I'm a PhD student at the UC Berkeley School of Information where I study the design and development of digital technologies and the people who use them. As a member of the [BioSENSE research group](http://biosense.berkeley.edu), my research interests are the applications and implications of measuring, interpreting, and sharing various signals from our bodies and behaviors.
